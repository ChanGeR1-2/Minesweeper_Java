This is the *Minesweeper (Java)* project I made myself.

To play the game, you first need to input a number of mines you want to generate on the field. Then, the game will ask you for your action. type (number number free/mine) to make an action. Typing free will attempt to claim the selected cell. Typing mine will attempt to flag the selected cell.
